## üß™ The Calculation Formula

The calculation for volume points follows a **logarithmic scale**, which rewards higher volumes with progressively more points.

### **Core Formula**

$$\text{Points} = \text{floor}\left(\log_2\left(\frac{\text{Effective Volume}}{2}\right)\right) + 1$$

### **Definitions**

* **Effective Volume:** $\text{Your Daily Volume} \times \text{Selected Multiplier}$.
* $\log_2$: The **logarithm to the base 2**.
* $\text{floor}$: Rounds the result **down to the nearest whole number**.

### **Minimum Volume Requirement**

A minimum effective volume of **\$2** is required to start earning points. If your effective volume is less than \$2, you earn **0 points**.

### **Example Calculation**

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Daily Volume** | \$10,000 |
| **Multiplier** | 2x |
| **Effective Volume** | $\$10,000 \times 2 = \$20,000$ |

**Calculation Steps:**

1.  $\text{Points} = \text{floor}(\log_2(20000 / 2)) + 1$
2.  $\text{Points} = \text{floor}(\log_2(10000)) + 1$
3.  $\text{Points} = \text{floor}(13.28) + 1$
4.  $\text{Points} = 13 + 1 = 14$ **points per day.**
